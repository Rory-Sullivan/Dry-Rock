      <p>
        The big news is Washington has been added as a region! After living in Washington for two years I have finally
        got around to adding it to Dry Rock.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition this update:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adds the ability to switch between metric and imperial units (so that we don't confuse the Americans who will
          be using the site now)
        </li>
        <li>Adds new forecast variables: humidity, and cloud cover</li>
        <li>
          Adds additional colour code indicators, now with three levels, <span class="bg-success-subtle">good</span>,
          <span class="bg-warning-subtle">okay</span>, and <span class="bg-danger-subtle">bad</span>, and includes
          additional variables temperature, wind speed, etc.
        </li>
        <li>Adds 'previous day' and 'next day' buttons to the detailed day forecast tables</li>
        <li>Does a general overhaul of the UI</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="v2.1.0" class="mb-5">
      <h2>v2.1.0 <small class="text-muted">1 November 2024</small></h2>
      <p>
        New locations added! The following locations have been added to the Dry Rock forecast;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower Cove (Mournes)</li>
        <li>Cruit Island</li>
        <li>Garron Point</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="v2.0.0" class="mb-5">
      <h2>v2.0.0 <small class="text-muted">14 August 2020</small></h2>
      <p>
        Dry Rock version 2 is here!
      </p>
      <p>
        With the Yr weather API being deprecated later this year, version 2 now uses MET Norway's
        <a href="https://api.met.no/">weather API</a>. This means that forecast data is now exact to
        each crag rather than being taken from the nearest town. Hopefully this will mean more
        accurate forecasts!
      </p>
      <p>
        There have also been improvements to the general design of the site:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first column of tables are now fixed, this should improve viewing experiences on small devices</li>
        <li>A new hourly forecast table has been added</li>
        <li><a href="/pages/about.html">About</a> and <a href="/pages/news.html">News</a> pages have been added, to keep
          you
          all up to date</li>
        <li>Finally, a shiny new navbar at the top of all pages has been added</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="v1.0.0" class="mb-5">
      <h2>v1.0.0 <small class="text-muted">25 May 2020</small></h2>
      <p>
        The initial release of the Dry Rock site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dry Rock is a site designed to help climbers in Ireland find some dry rock to
        climb on. Weather forecast data is collected from <a href="https://www.yr.no/en">Yr</a>,
        provided by the <a href="https://www.met.no/en">Norwegian Meteorological Institute</a>.
