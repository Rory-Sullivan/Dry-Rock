        Ever found yourself clicking through seemingly endless forecasts trying to figure out where
        to go climbing this weekend? Well then you've come to the right place!

      <p>
        Dry Rock is designed to be a one stop shop for figuring out where to climb this weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="/#overview">overview</a> section has a seven day summary of the rainfall for popular
        climbing destinations in Ireland. Low rainfall values are shown in
        <span class="text-success">green</span> to make them easier to spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking a row in the table will take you too a 7-day forecast for that place and clicking a
        row in that table will show you a pop up with an hourly (or 6-hourly) detailed forecast for
        that day. Clicking the overiew button will take you back to the overview table.
